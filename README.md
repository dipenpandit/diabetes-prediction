# diabetes-prediction
Predicting the chances of having diabetes using Artificial Neural Networks. 
- A dataset including the patient's medical data as the features and the patient's diabetes status as the target(i.e. whether the patient was diabetic or not) was used.
- The dataset was split into the train, validation, and test set.
- The train and validation sets were used for model evaluation and selection.
- The test set was used for model generalization to see how well the model performs on the unseen data.
- The best model i.e. the model with the lowest validation error was saved and used for prediction.
